## Watch tests

I can use `watch -n 1 go test` to re-run tests every 1 second. Ideally this
would watch the folder and only re-run on change but this is good enough to get
started with.

## Inline hints

The go extension in VSCode has an option to turn on "inlay hints" that shows
what each paramter is being assigned to in a function call or in struct
creation. These options are under `Go -> Inlay hints` and make programming so
much nicer.
